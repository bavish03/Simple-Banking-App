This is a beginner-level Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) console application written in Java. It simulates the basic operations of a bank ATM, allowing a user to interact with a single bank account object.

This project contains two major things: the Account class manages the money, and the SimpleBankingApp class handles the user interaction.
